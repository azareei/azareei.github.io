<h2 id="sec-1">Some resources for graduate students?!</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>
These are recommendation based on my own experience for new graduate
students, in different areas. I found them helpful throughout my
graduate studies. I should tell you that I have not read all of them,
but those unread ones are on my bucket list. 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1">Research:</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming">Richard Hamming</a>, the prominent American mathematician, gave a series
of lectures (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2FF649D0C4407B30">Learning to Learn</a>), which are enlightening. The most
important one that every graduate student, I think should watch is
entitled "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw">You and your research</a>". You might also enjoy other lectures
on "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlTybZvds0U">Creativity</a>" or "<a href="https://youtu.be/AD4b-52jtos?list=PL2FF649D0C4407B30">The art of doing science and engineering</a>".

<h3 id="sec-1-2">Writing:</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
This is an indispensable part of graduate school activity. Every
graduate should be able to easily convey what he understands through
research papers, talks or lectures in general. Clarity, grammer,
punctuation, and ordering are just a couple of things you should
always have in mind. It needs investing and practice to master! These are
a couple of books to better help you with writing:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style">The elements of Style</a>: This is very short book on principles of
composition. This book is nails on basics you need to know. 
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style:_Lessons_in_Clarity_and_Grace">Style: Lessens in Clarity and Grace</a>: This is a great book towards
writing clearly. 
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Manual_for_Writers_of_Research_Papers,_Theses,_and_Dissertations"> A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses and Dissertations</a>:

and dissertation.
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicago_Manual_of_Style">The Chicago Manual of Style</a>: This is like a reference book for
widely used and respected writing style in the US.
</li>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Peyton_Jones">Simon Peytons</a>, computer scientist, has given a talk on "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3dkRsTqdDA">How to write

<h3 id="sec-1-3">Presentation:</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
We can't avoid presentations. It's better to prepare and learn how to
present and with practice master the art of presentation. Here are a couple of
reading suggestions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Peyton_Jones">Simon Peytons</a> talks also on giving presentations: "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_-owjKIbA">How to give
great research talk?</a>"
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cialdini">Robert Cialdini</a> has a book on "Influence: The Psychology of
Persuation". He has recently published the book as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence:_Science_and_Practice">Influence:

weapons of influence.

career. 
</li>

<li>Professor David Patterson, computer scientist, gave a lecture in
Berkeley, as his last lecutre where he talked about "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK6EPvrmcBk">How to be a bad
