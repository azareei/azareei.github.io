      centuries. In recent years, however, nonlinear dynamics in
      fluids and solids have been having a revival with unseen
      applications, thanks to the exploitation of instabilities,
      nonlinearities, and also developments in computational and
      data-driven tools. My research is centered on nonlinear dynamics
      in fluids and solids where I harness instabilities and
      geometrical/material nonlinearities to enable exceptional
      functionalities and novel applications. Throughout this process,
      I develop computational or data-driven tools as required. In my
      research, I utilize a range of mathematical techniques from
      reduced order models and homogenization techniques to machine
      learning and data science to understand and exploit
      geometrical/material nonlinearities, instabilities, and disorder
      in systems, and I finally validate the predictions using
      experiments. I believe my expertise in the areas of applied
      mechanics, fluid dynamics, and applied mathematics along with
      computational data-science benefit me in accomplishing my
        research goals. </font> </p>

<h1>Previous Works</h1>


<p> <font size="4">During my PhD and postdoctorate year, I worked on multiple projects
focused on wave dynamics, nonlinearities, instabilities, and disorder
in solids and fluids. Specifically, during my Ph.D. I developed
nonlinear transformation techniques for an arbitrary passive steering
of surface gravity waves (Fluids) and flexural waves (Solids) and
applied them to create invisibility cloaks, energy harvesting devices,
and also waveguides for signal transmission purposes. Moreover to the
wave control projects, I worked on identifying a new instability
mechanism in internal waves (Fluids) and also understanding the Bragg
resonance between internal waves and topographies. During my
postdoctoral year, I harnessed nonlinear transitional waves in
bistable chains to realize robust deployable structures (Solids). More
recently, I began developing data-driven methods for model discovery
and approximation of nonlinear dynamical systems in order to enable
robust future predictions in nonlinear systems for fluids or
solids. During these projects, along with analytical approaches, I
created numerical models for the simulation of partial differential
equations (such as higher order spectral methods (HOS), finite
elements methods (FEM), discrete analysis, and finite difference) and
for the experiments I collaborated with experimentalists. Due to the
enormous importance of experiments in scientific studies, during my
postdoctorate year, I started creating my own experimental setups and
gained valuable knowledge in the process. </p> </font>

    <td ><strong> <font size="5">Nonlinear Transformation and
    Invisibility Cloaks (Fluids/Solids)</font> </strong> <br> A cloak
    is two- or three-dimensional patch that encloses an object (to be
    made invisible), and is designed to direct the waves around the
    central object, shielding that region or object from incident
    waves, and hence making it invisible. During my Ph.D., I developed
    a nonlinear transformation to create cloaks with reduced material
    complexities i.e., using layers of homogeneous material. Using
    this nonlinear transformation, I successfully designed and
    numerically/experimentally validated broadband invisibility cloaks
    for (i) surface gravity waves (Fluids) in shallow water/finite
    depth, and also for (ii) flexural waves (Solids).

          spatial inhomogeneous refractive index can be determined
          with reverse engineering. Using an inhomogeneous elastic
          seabed, I successfully developed a broadband wave guide for

          carry wave energy for large distances [8]. In the case of
          flexural waves (Solids), using spatial inhomogenity in

          lens, and showed a general way to maneuver flexrual

          Waves (Solids)</font></strong><br> A carefully designed 1D
          linkage mechanism can become bistable due to its geometric
          nonlinearity. A chain of bistable elements support
          transition waves propagation that sequentially switch
          bistable elements from one stable configuration to
          another. Transition waves have received significant interest
          in recent years not only because of their rich physics, but
          also for their potential applications, including
          unidirectional propagation, energy harvesting and mechanical
          computation. In my postdoctorate, we exploited the
          propagation of transition waves in a bistable 1D linkage as
          a robust mechanism to realize structures that can be quickly
          deployed. With a combination of experiments and analyses, we
          showed that if the bistable joints are properly designed,
          transition waves can propagate throughout the entire
          structure and transform the initial straight configuration
          into a curved one. We then demonstrated that such bistable
          linkages can be used as building blocks to realize
          deployable 3D structures of arbitrary shape.

    interior of a fluid and are caused by density stratification. A
    slight change in liquid density, which occurs often in the ocean,
    causes significantly large internal waves.  Moreover, internal
    waves play an essential role in weather condition, mixing, and
    circulation in the ocean through their breaking.  The energy
    transport mechanism is currently not well understood.  In my prior
    research, we identified a second-harmonic instability mechanism
    which describes the transfer of internal wave energy to higher
    frequencies. This instability offers a new potential mechanism for
    energy transfer to higher modes that results in wave breaking. We
    furthermore characterized the way in which internal waves in ocean
    interact with the sea-bed through Bragg resonance which
    potentially explains experimentally observed areas of high-mixing
    within the ocean.

      shallow water</font></a></strong><br> A major obstacle in designing a
      perfect cloak for objects in shallow-water waves is that the
      linear transformation media scheme (also known as transformation
      optics) requires spatial variations of two independent medium
      properties. In the Maxwell’s equation and for the well-studied
      problem of electromagnetic cloaking, these two properties are
      permittivity and permeability. Designing an anisotropic material
      with both variable permittivity and variable permeability, while
      challenging, is achievable. On the other hand, for long gravity
      waves, whose governing equation maps one-to-one to the single
      polarization Maxwell’s equations, the two required spatially
      variable properties are the water depth and the gravitational
      acceleration; in this case changing the gravitational
      acceleration is simply impossible. Here we present a nonlinear
      transformation that only requires the change in one of the
      medium properties, which, in the case of shallow-water waves, is
      the water depth, while keeping the gravitational acceleration
      constant. This transformation keeps the governing equation
      perfectly intact and, if the cloak is large enough,
      asymptotically satisfies the necessary boundary conditions.

      for elastic waves in flexural plates is not form invariant, and
      hence designing a cloak for such waves faces a major
      challenge. Here, we present the design of a perfect broadband
      cloak for flexural waves through the use of a nonlinear
      transformation in the region of the cloak and by matching term
      by term the original and transformed equations and also assuming
      a prestressed material with body forces. For a readily
      achievable flexural cloak in a physical setting, we further
      present an approximate adoption of our perfect cloak under more
      restrictive physical constraints. Through direct simulation of
      the governing equations, we show that this cloak, as well,
      maintains a consistently high cloaking efficiency over a broad
      range of frequencies. The methodology developed here may be used
      for steering waves and designing cloaks in other physical
      systems with non-form-invariant governing equations.

    GRIN Lens </font></a></strong><br> A significant challenge in
    flexural wave energy harvesting is the design of an
    aberration-free lens capable of finely focusing waves over a broad
    frequency range. To date, flexural lenses have been created using
    discrete inclusions, voids, or stubs, often in a periodic
    arrangement, to focus waves via scattering. These structures are
    narrowband either because scattering is efficient over a small
    frequency range, or the arrangements exploit Bragg scattering
    bandgaps, which themselves are narrowband. In addition, current
    lens designs are based on a single frequency and approximate the
    necessary refractive index profile discretely, introducing
    aberrations and frequency-dependent focal points. Here, we design
    a flexural GRIN lens in a thin plate by smoothly varying the
    plate’s rigidity, and thus its refractive index. Our lens (i) is
    broadband, since the design does not depend on frequency and does
    not require bandgaps, (ii) has a fixed focal point over a wide
    range of frequencies, and (iii) is theoretically capable of
    zero-aberration focusing. We numerically explore our Continuous
    Profile GRIN lens (CP-GRIN lens) and then experimentally validate
    an implemented design. Furthermore, we use a piezoelectric energy
    harvester disk, located at the first focus of the CP-GRIN, to
      document improvements in power gain. [<a href="http://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.5008576">PDF</a>]

    between topographic features and internal
    waves</font></a></strong><br> Interaction of stratified flows with
    the solid bottom boundary is a main source for generation of
    internal waves. This interaction can lead to generation of
    near-inertial internal waves which appear as a prominent peak in
    the internal wave spectrum. In some specific occasions, if the
    bottom topography wavenumber is an integer coefficient of the
    wavenumber of incident internal wave, the interaction could lead
    to generation of high wavenumer internal waves which are
    potentially susceptible to breaking. Here we show that the
    distribution of energy of internal gravity waves over a patch of
    seabed corrugations strongly depends on the distance of the patch
    to adjacent seafloor features located downstream of the
      patch.[<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/sensitivity-of-internal-wave-energy-distribution-over-seabed-corrugations-to-adjacent-seabed-features/0369A332EED59E8E7986B4473D336D61">PDF</a>]

    Unstable Internal Waves due to Resonant Harmonic
    Generation</font></a></strong><br> Here we show that there exist
    internal gravity waves that are inherently unstable, that is, they
    cannot exist in nature for a long time. The instability mechanism
    is a one-way (irreversible) harmonic-generation resonance that
    permanently transfers the energy of an internal wave to its higher
    harmonics. We show that, in fact, there are a countably infinite
    number of such unstable waves. For the harmonic-generation
    resonance to take place, nonlinear terms in the free surface
    boundary condition play a pivotal role, and the instability does
    not occur in a linearly-stratified fluid if a simplified boundary
    condition such as a rigid lid or a linearized boundary condition
    is employed. Harmonic-generation resonance presented here also
    provides a mechanism for the transfer of internal wave energy to
    the higher-frequency part of the spectrum where internal waves are
    more prone to breaking, hence losing energy to turbulence and heat
    and contributing to oceanic mixing.

    behaviors has been observed experimentally in the hydrodynamics of
    a bouncing droplet on a vibrant fluid bath. Supported by recent
    experiments, we have been recently working on a mathematical map
    between Schrodinger equation describing quantum systems and
    Euler’s equation describing classical small scale water waves. We
    are excited to investigate the implication, potentials, and limits
    of this fundamental transformation to (i) find a physical
    understanding of quantum behaviors observed in micro-scale fluid
    systems, (ii) potentially develop an equivalent hydrodynamic
    setups for quantum experiments and vice versa, and (iii)
    investigate possibility of a hydrodynamic quantum computer for
    solving complex problems.
