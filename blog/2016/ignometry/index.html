    <h1 id="the-art-of-mapping-the-unknown-for-accelerated-learning-and-progress">The Art of Mapping the Unknown for Accelerated Learning and Progress</h1>

<p>We often define knowledge as an understanding or awareness of facts and information that we are already aware of or <em>we know</em>. However, I propose a shift in this perception. In my view, knowledge should represent our understanding or awareness of the things <em>we do not know</em>.</p>

<p>Why so? In this digital age, we are surrounded by a vast sea of information, easily and quickly accessible. Despite this, truly mastering a field – understanding its depths, limitations and unanswered questions – requires time and expertise. Hence, real knowledge should encompass our awareness of the unanswered questions, the unknown territories within our field of interest.</p>

<p>In the scientific community, this approach should be prevalent. The primary goal should be to identify, comprehend, and measure unanswered questions. But why the emphasis on measurement? Simply because progress is impossible without it. By understanding and defining the boundaries of the unknown (measuring the unknown), we take our first step towards knowledge. This process of understanding and measuring the unknown, I call “Ignometry”.</p>

<p>In our educational system, I firmly believe that teachers should familiarize students with the knowns as well as the unknowns. Wouldn’t it be exciting and motivating for a student to hear a teacher say, “Here are the things we don’t yet know in this area” or “These questions remain unanswered”?</p>

<p>Similarly, in the research community, there should be a more defined path towards mapping the unknowns. I often find myself pondering on the open questions in our field, the problems for which we still don’t have clear answers. What do we know about these problems? Which ones can we solve with our current knowledge? I am of the opinion that everyone should dedicate a part of their time to “Ignometry” and then inspire others to do the same. This practice could significantly accelerate our progress in science. I personally devote an afternoon each week to “Ignometry”, exploring and trying to understand the boundaries of the unknown.</p>

<!--
<p>
Knowledge is understanding or awareness of facts and information that <i>we know</i>; however, I think knowledge should be defined as understanding or awareness of information that <i>we do not know</i>!  
</p>

<p>
You might ask why? In our time information is abundant! You could easily and  quickly find out about an idea, method, information or a skill. However, it takes time to master the field&#x2013;understand its boundaries and limitation. It takes an expert to find unanswered questions, understand, and measure them! Thus, having knowledge translates into the awareness of questions that are unanswered or unknown!
</p>

<p>
This should actually be the practice in the scientific community! Finding, understanding, and <i>measuring</i> what unanswered questions are. Why do we need measurement, you might ask. We require measurement to have progress. Understanding the boundaries of a unknown (measuring the unknown) is the first step in understanding. We should measure the unknown to tackle it and proceed. I call this process <b>Ignometry</b> (ignotus=unknown, metry=measuring, measuring the unknown). 
</p>

<p>
I believe, in our schools, professors should teach the students what we do not know at least beside what we already know. Have you ever seen a professor coming to a class and tell you: here are the things we don't know in the area! or here are questions that are still unanswered! I believe it creates much excitement and motivation in the fresh minds of students. 
</p>

<p>
The same story goes into research community! There is no clear picture&#x2013;a map for the unknowns. I keep asking myself: what are open questions in our field? What problems we don't still have a clear answer for? What do we know about them? Which ones are we able to tackle with our current knowledge? I believe everyone should devote a potion of his/her own time to <b>Ignometry</b> and then pass this torch forward. This will exponentially increase our progress and pace in science! Everyweek I am expending an afternoon on <b>Ignometry</b> and try to understand the boundries of the unknown!
