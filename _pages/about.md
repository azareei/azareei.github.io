I am currently Senior AI research scientist at <a href="https://about.meta.com">Meta</a> pushing the boundaries of what's possible in computer vision for AR/VR applications using cutting-edge AI/ML techniques.


Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral fellow in Applied Mathematics in <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/">SEAS</a> at <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a>  where I had the privilege of working alongside renowned researchers Drs. <a href="https://bertoldi.seas.harvard.edu/">Katia Bertoldi</a> and <a href="https://amir.seas.harvard.edu/">Ariel Amir</a> on applications of AI in physics.

I received my Ph.D./M.Sc. in Engineering at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>. I was advised by Professor <a href="https://www.me.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/m-reza-alam">M. Reza Alam</a>.

<!-- My Ph.D. research was mainly focused on nonlinear wave dynamics and it was funded in part by <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a>. I was PI for <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/berkeleyfluids/index.html">Berkeley Fluids Seminar</a> from 2015-2018. -->

I got my second M.A. in <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/">Applied Mathematics</a> at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley</a> advised by Prof. <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~wilken/">Jon Wilkening</a>. In my thesis, I found a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.12253.pdf"> transformation to map hydrodynamics Euler's equations to the Schr<span>&#246;</span>dinger equation</a>. I received my B.Sc. in Engineering and Physics (double major) from <a href="http://www.sharif.ir/web/en/">Sharif University of Technology</a>.

<!-- During my undergrad, I worked with Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mirabbasjalali/">Mir A. Jalali</a> on Simulation of perturbed stellar systems using CUDA programming. -->

You can find my mathematical genealogy in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Ahmad-genealogy.png">here</a>. It was interesting to see [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton), [Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss), [Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace), [Fourier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier), [Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler), [Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert), [Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bernoulli), [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz), [Dirichelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gustav_Lejeune_Dirichlet) in my genealogy tree.  It's truly fascinating to see the roots of my genealogy tree beginning with [Nasir al-Din Tusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir_al-Din_al-Tusi), a well-known Persian polymath from the 13th century.

Fluids simulations for incompressible, inviscid Navier-Stokes equation solved with black tracers; <br> initial velocity field is optimized using backpropagation such that the initial pattern of my first name "AHMAD" <br> transforms into the my last name "ZAREEI". The optimization is done using automatic <br> differentiation or backpropagation. You can find the code in my github.
